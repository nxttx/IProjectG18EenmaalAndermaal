                    <h3 class="title is-4 is-marginless">Comments</h3>
                    <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also
                        the visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
                    <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the
                        Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available
                        here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is
                        visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
                    <h3 class="title is-4 is-marginless">Media</h3>
                    <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location
                        data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data
                        from images on the website.</p>
                    <h3 class="title is-4 is-marginless">Cookies</h3>
                    <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website
                        in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again
                        when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
                    <p>If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine
                        if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you
                        close your browser.</p>
                    <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your
                        screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a
                        year. If you select &#8220;Remember Me&#8221;, your login will persist for two weeks. When you
                        log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
                    <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This
                        cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just
                        edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
                    <h3 class="title is-4 is-marginless">Embedded content from other websites</h3>
                    <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
                        Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited
                        the other website.</p>
                    <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking,
                        and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with
                        the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
                    <h3 class="title is-4 is-marginless">Analytics</h3>

                    <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
                        recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a
                        moderation queue.</p>
                    <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they

                        any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
                        edit that information. We reserve all rights to terminate accounts, edit or remove content and
                        cancel orders in their sole discretion.</p>

                        exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to

                        include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
